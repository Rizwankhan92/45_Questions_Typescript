// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name,
//  print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same,
//   but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let nam: string[] = ["Rizwan", "Usama", "Huzaifa"];

nam.forEach((name) => {
  console.log(`Here is a name of typescript lover: ${name}`);
});
