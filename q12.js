// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name,
//  print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same,
//   but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var nam = ["Rizwan", "Usama", "Huzaifa"];
nam.forEach(function (name) {
    console.log("Here is a name of typescript lover: ".concat(name));
});
